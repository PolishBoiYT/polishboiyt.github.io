        Hello! I am a human that likes programming. Which is why you're here.<br>
        This website's JS file is made using JQuery which is great as it supports IE 6 and Safari.<br>
        "oh but who uses IE or Safari?" People who don't care about new features or use their old computer from... i dunno 1999?<br>
        For safari, it's people with macOS or iOS or whatever.<br>
        <br>
        And the reason i used W3Spaces (a thing on W3Schools) is because well, atleast i don't have to deal with updating the website and waiting YEARS for the changes to take effect.<br>
        And because i can make a custom URL... with an exception of the "w3spaces.com" at the end. But who cares? I don't need the github.io thing! I really want a custom domain though...<br>
        This website is for sharing some stuff i've been working on. Like the <a href="https://nswishball.github.io">previous website! :D</a>

                <li>This website was hosted using W3Spaces</li>
                <li>What else... Oh yeah this website is for sharing some stuff... like the <a href="https://nswishball.github.io">previous website.</a></li>
