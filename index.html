        Hello! I am a human that likes programming. Which is why you're here.<br>
        This website's JS file is made using JQuery which is great as it supports IE 6 and Safari.<br>
        "oh but who uses IE or Safari?" People who don't care about new features or use their old computer from... i dunno 1999?<br>
        For safari, it's people with macOS or iOS or whatever.<br>
        <br>
        This website is for sharing some stuff i've been working on. Like the <a href="https://nswishball.github.io">previous website! :D</a>
